### Running / Debugging Lambdas Locally

Following Serverless V.3 reaching end of support and a decision not to [upgrade to Serverless V.4](https://wb.serverless.com/framework/docs-guides-upgrading-v4), running / debugging Lambdas is **not** supported temporarily.
Alternative technlogies will be used to provide this functionality as soon as possible
